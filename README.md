### Abstract:
The application is a motivational poster generator that allows users to create, view, and save personalized posters featuring motivational quotes and images. It also includes a section for humorous "unmotivational" posters, providing a lighthearted contrast. By enabling users to generate and customize content, the app addresses the need for accessible motivational material while also offering a playful take on motivation through its unmotivational section.

### Installation Instructions:
To get the app cloned and running, a person would need to clone the GitHub repository to their local machine using Git, then navigate to the project directory in their terminal. Once in the project directory, they can open the HTML file in a web browser to interact with the app.

### Preview of App:


### Context:
I had 10 days to work on this project during Module 2 of the Turing program. This project demonstrates my growing skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and web application development as I progress through the Turing curriculum.

### Learning Goals:
1. Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
2. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
3. Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
4. Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
5. Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
6. Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

These learning goals focused on improving JavaScript skills, understanding code structure and best practices, working with the DOM, and implementing design specifications.

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:

A significant win is the implementation of the "unmotivational" posters section, which adds a unique and humorous twist to the application. The code demonstrates a good understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and array methods in JavaScript. The project also shows an effort to organize code into reusable functions, such as showAndHidePage and createPoster, which is a step towards writing more maintainable code.

Challenges:

The delete saved posters feature proved to be a significant challenge during the development of this project. Initially, I attempted various approaches to implement this functionality, including adding an index to the posters and experimenting with different methods of identifying and removing the selected poster. These attempts included using array methods like splice and trying to match the clicked poster with its corresponding data in the unmotivationalPosters array. Despite these efforts, the delete function wasn't working as expected. After much troubleshooting and code review, I discovered a bug in my implementation that was preventing the function from operating correctly. This experience highlighted the importance of careful debugging and the need to thoroughly understand how different parts of the code interact.
